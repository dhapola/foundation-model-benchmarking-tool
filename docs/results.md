# Results

Depending upon the experiments in the config file, the `FMBench` run may take a few minutes to several hours. Once the run completes, you can find the report and metrics in the local `results-*` folder in the directory from where `FMBench` was run. The rpeort and metrics are also written to the write S3 bucket set in the [config file](https://github.com/aws-samples/foundation-model-benchmarking-tool/blob/main/src/fmbench/configs/config-mistral-7b-tgi-g5.yml#L12).

Here is a screenshot of the `report.md` file generated by `FMBench`.
