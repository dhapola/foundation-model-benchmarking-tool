# Bring your own `REST Predictor` ([`data-on-eks`](https://github.com/awslabs/data-on-eks/tree/7173cd98c9be6f555afc42f8311cc7849f74a038) version)

`FMBench` now provides an example of bringing your own endpoint as a `REST Predictor` for benchmarking. View this [`script`](https://github.com/aws-samples/foundation-model-benchmarking-tool/blob/REST-predictor-fmbench/src/fmbench/scripts/rest_predictor.py) as an example. This script is an inference file for the `NousResearch/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf` model deployed on an [Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service.html) cluster using [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/examples.html). The model is deployed via `data-on-eks` which is a comprehensive resource for scaling your data and machine learning workloads on Amazon EKS and unlocking the power of Gen AI. Using `data-on-eks`, you can harness the capabilities of AWS Trainium, AWS Inferentia and NVIDIA GPUs to scale and optimize your Gen AI workloads and benchmark those models on FMBench with ease.
